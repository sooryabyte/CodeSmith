# CodeSmith â€“ AI-Powered Code Generation Platform

CodeSmith is an intelligent coding assistant built on top of the **Astra** agentic AI framework. It simulates a software-engineering team where multiple specialized agents collaborate to generate, review, test, and document code across multiple programming languages.

---

##  Features
- **Agentic multi-role workflow**: Agents collaborate like a real engineering team.
- **Multi-language support**: Extendable to generate and validate code in Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more.
- **Local LLM integration**: Works with Ollama for offline model hosting; optional support for OpenAI and Gemini.

##  Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository, create/activate a virtual environment, install Python dependencies, pull an Ollama model, and run the Streamlit app (all commands shown below):

    git clone https://github.com/sooryabyte/codesmith.git
    cd codesmith

    ### Create virtual environment (POSIX)
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    ### Or Windows (PowerShell)
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    ### Install required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ### Install and configure Ollama (follow instructions at https://ollama.ai)
    ### Example: pull a coding model (Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B)
    ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b

    ### Run the Streamlit frontend
    streamlit run CodeSmith.py

---

##  Usage

- Open the Streamlit URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) shown in your terminal after launching.
- Enter a natural-language task (e.g., "Implement a REST endpoint in Flask that returns the sum of numbers") and submit.
- Run the application

---

##  Notes
- **Security & safety**: When running arbitrary generated code, use sandboxing where possible. The included Python REPL tool is convenient for demos but avoid running untrusted code on production hosts.
- **Extensibility**: Add new `Agent` roles by defining agent instances and hooking them into the workflow. Add language-specific test tools to support more languages.
- **Reproducibility**: Pin models and dependency versions in `requirements.txt` to ensure consistent behaviour across environments.
